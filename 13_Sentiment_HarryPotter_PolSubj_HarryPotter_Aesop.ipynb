'Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now I've got the basics.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So you've stopped having funny dreams?' said Hermione sceptically.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Pretty much,' said Harry, not looking at her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I don't think Snape should stop until you're absolutely sure you can control them!' said Hermione indignantly. 'Harry, I think you should go back to him and ask - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry forcefully. 'Just drop it, Hermione, OK?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was the first day of the Easter holidays and Hermione, as was her custom, had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for the three of them. Harry and Ron had let her do it; ii. was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How can that come as a shock?' Hermione demanded, as she tapped each little square on Ron's timetable with her wand so that il flashed a different colour according to its subject.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Ron, 'there's been a lot going on.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, there you are,' she said, handing him his timetable, 'if you follow that you should do fine.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You've given me an evening off every week!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'That's for Quidditch practice,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The smile faded from Ron's face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's the point?' he said dully. 'We've got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad's got of becoming Minister for Magic.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione said nothing; she was looking at Harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while Crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's wrong, Harry?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' he said quickly. 'Nothing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He seized his copy of Defensive Magical Theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index. Crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under Hermione's chair.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I saw Cho earlier,' said Hermione tentatively. 'She looked really miserable, too . . . have you two had a row again?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Wha- oh, yeah, we have,' said Harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What about?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That sneak friend of hers, Marietta,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, well, I don't blame you!' said Ron angrily, setting down his revision timetable. 'If it hadn't been for her . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron went into a rant about Marietta Edgecombe, which Harry found helpful; all he had to do was look angry, nod and say 'Yeah' and That's right' whenever Ron drew breath, leaving his mind free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the Pensieve.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. He had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions Snape cast on his father's character. Hadn't people like Hagrid and Sirius told Harry how wonderful his father had been? (Yeah, well, look what Sirius was like himself, said a nagging voice inside Harry's head . . . he was as bad, wasn't he?) Yes, he had once overheard Professor McGonagall saying that his father and Sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she had described them as forerunners of the Weasley twins, and Harry could not imagine Fred and George dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it . . . not unless they really loathed them . . . perhaps Malfoy or somebody who really deserved it .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James's hands: but hadn't Lily asked, 'What's he done to you?' And hadn't James replied, 'It's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean.' Hadn't James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored? Harry remembered Lupin saying back in Grimmauld Place that Dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over James and Sirius . . . but in the Pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry kept reminding himself that Lily had intervened; his mother had been decent. Yet, the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at James disturbed him quite as much as anything else; she had clearly loathed James, and Harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married. Once or twice he even wondered whether James had forced her into it . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James, he had glowed with pride inside. And now . . . now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The weather grew breezier, brighter and warmer as the Easter holidays passed, but Harry, along with the rest of the fifth- and seventh-years, was trapped inside, revising, traipsing back and forth to the library. Harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and as his fellow Gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, his excuse went unchallenged.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, I'm talking to you, can you hear me?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Huh?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked round. Ginny Weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone. It was late on Sunday evening: Hermione had gone back to Gryffindor Tower to revise Ancient Runes, and Ron had Quidditch practice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, hi,' said Harry, pulling his books towards him. 'How come you're not at practice?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's over,' said Ginny. 'Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we're not sure, but we think he knocked himself out with\\u00a0 \\u00a0 his own bat.' She sighed heavily. 'Anyway . . . a package just arrived, it's only just got through Umbridge's new screening process.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table; it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly re-wrapped. There was a scribbled note across it in red ink, reading: Inspected and Passed by the Hogwarts High Inquisitor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's Easter eggs from Mum,' said Ginny. There's one for you . . . there you go.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small, iced Snitches and, according to the packaging, containing a bag of Fizzing Whizzbees. Harry looked at it for a moment, then, to his horror, felt a lump rise in his throat.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you OK, Harry?' Ginny asked quietly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, I'm fine,' said Harry gruffly. The lump in his throat was painful. He did not understand why an Easter egg should have made him feel like this.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You seem really down lately,' Ginny persisted. 'You know, I'm sure if you just talked to Cho . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's not Cho I want to talk to,' said Harry brusquely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Who is it, then?' asked Ginny, watching him closely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening. Madam Pince was several shelves away, stamping out a pile cf books for a frantic-looking Hannah Abbott.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I wish I could talk to Sirius,' he muttered. 'But I know I can't.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully. More to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any, Harry unwrapped his Easter egg, broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Ginny slowly, helping herself to a bit of egg, too, 'if you really want to talk to Sirius, I expect we could think of a way to do it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Come on,' said Harry dully. 'With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The thing about growing up with Fred and George,' said Ginny thoughtfully, 'is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry looked at her. Perhaps it was the effect of the chocolate - '- Lupin had always advised eating some after encounters with Dementors - or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week, but he felt a bit more hopeful.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh damn,' whispered Ginny, jumping to her feet. 'I forgot - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Madam Pince was swooping down on them, her shrivelled face contorted with rage.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Chocolate in the library!' she screamed. 'Out - out - OUT!' And whipping out her wand, she caused Harry's books, bag and ink bottle to chase him and Ginny from the library, whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran.*As though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations, a batch of pamphlets, leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in Gryffindor Tower shortly before the end of the holidays, along with yet another notice on the board, which read:CAREERS ADVICEAll fifth-years are required to attend a short meeting with theirHead of House during the first week of the summer term to discusstheir future careers. Times of individual appointments are listed below.Harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in Professor McGonagall's office at half past two on Monday, which would mean missing most of Divination. He and the other fifth-years spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the Easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I don't fancy Healing,' said Ron on the last evening of the holidays. He was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed bone-and-wand emblem of St Mungo's on its front. 'It says here you need at least \\\\E\\\\\\\" at NEWT level in Potions, Herbology, Transfiguration, Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts. I mean . . . blimey . . . don't want much, do they?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, it's a very responsible job, isn't it?' said Hermione absently.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet, that was headed, 'SO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO WORK IN MUGGLE RELATIONS?' 'You don't seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles; all they want is an OWL in Muggle Studies: Much more important is your enthusiasm, patience and a good sense of fun!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle,' said Harry darkly. 'Good sense of when to duck, more like.' He was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking. 'Listen to this: Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel, adventure and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank, who are currently recruiting Curse-Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad . . . They want Arithmancy, though; you could do it, Hermione!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't much fancy banking,' said Hermione vaguely, now immersed in: 'HAVE YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO TRAIN SECURITY TROLLS?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hey,' said a voice in Harry's ear. He looked round; Fred and George had come to join them. 'Ginny's had a word with us about you,' said Fred, stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the Ministry of Magic to slide off on to the floor. 'She says you need to talk to Sirius?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Hermione sharply, freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up 'MAKE A BANG AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MAGICAL ACCIDENTS AND CATASTROPHES'.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah . . .' said Harry, trying to sound casual, 'yeah, I thought I'd like - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't be so ridiculous,' said Hermione, straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes. 'With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we think we can find a way around that,' said George, stretching and smiling. 'It's a simple matter of causing a diversion. Now, you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What was the point, we asked ourselves, of disrupting leisure time?' continued Fred. 'No point at all, we answered ourselves. And of course, we'd have messed up people's revision, too, which would be the very last thing we'd want to do.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He gave Hermione a sanctimonious little nod. She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But it's business as usual from tomorrow,' Fred continued briskly. 'And if we're going to be causing a bit of uproar, why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, but still,' said Hermione, with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse, 'even if you do cause a diversion, how is Harry supposed to talk to him?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Umbridge's office,' said Harry quietly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative. Umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are - you - insane?' said Hermione in a hushed voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the Cultivated Fungus Trade and was watching the conversation warily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't think so,' said Harry, shrugging.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And how are you going to get in there in the first place?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was ready for this question.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sirius's knife,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Excuse me?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that'll open any lock,' said Harry. 'So even if she's bewitched the door so Alahomora won't work, which I bet she has - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What do you think about this?' Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry's first dinner in Grimmauld Place.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Ron, looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion. 'If Harry wants to do it, it's up to him, isn't it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Spoken like a true friend and Weasley,' said Fred, clapping Ron hard on the back. 'Right, then. We're thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact ii everybody's in the corridors - Harry, we'll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office - I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?' he said, looking at George.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Easy,' said George.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What sort of diversion is it?' asked Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'll see, little bro', said Fred, as he and George got up again. 'At least, you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy's corridor round about five o'clock tomorrow.'*Harry awoke very early the next day, feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic. It was not only the prospect of breaking into Umbridge's office and using her fire to speak to Sirius that was making him feel nervous, though that was certainly bad enough; today also happened to be the first time Harry would be in close proximity to Snape since Snape had thrown him out of his office.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 After lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead, Harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside Neville's bed, and stared out on a truly glorious morning. The sky was a clear, misty, opalescent blue. Directly ahead of him, Harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented Snape. He was not sure what Sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the Pensieve, but he was desperate to hear Sirius's own account of what had happened, to know of any mitigating factors there might have been, any excuse at all for his fathers behaviour . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Something caught Harry's attention: movement on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. Harry squinted into the sun and saw Hagrid emerging from between the trees. He seemed to be limping. As Harry watched, Hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it. Harry watched the cabin for several minutes. Hagrid did not emerge again, but smoke furled from the chimney, so Hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal tc stoking the fire.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry turned away from the window, headed back to his trunk and started to dress.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 With the prospect of forcing entry into Umbridge's office ahead. Harry had never expected the day to be a restful one, but he had not reckoned on Hermione's almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five o'clock. For the first time ever, she was at least as inattentive to Professor Binns in\\u00a0 \\u00a0 History of Magic as Harry and Ron were, keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that Harry tried very hard to ignore.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 '. . . and if she does catch you there, apart from being expelled, she'll be able to guess you've been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she'll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hermione,' said Ron in a low and indignant voice, 'are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take my own notes?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You take notes for a change, it won't kill you!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 By the time they reached the dungeons, neither Harry nor Ron was speaking to Hermione. Undeterred, she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow oi dire warnings, all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused Seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Snape, meanwhile, seemed to have decided to act as though Harry were invisible. Harry was, of course, well-used to this tactic, as it was one of Uncle Vernons favourites, and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse. In fact, compared to what he usually had to endure from Snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks, he found the new approach something of an improvement, and was pleased to find that when left well alone, he was able to concoct an Invigoration Draught quite easily. At the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask, corked it and took it up to Snape's desk for marking, feeling that he might at last have scraped an 'E'.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise. Malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter. Harry whipped around. His potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and Snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Whoops,' he said softly. 'Another zero, then, Potter.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was too incensed to speak. He strode back to his cauldron, intending to fill another flask and force Snape to mark it, but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm sorry!' said Hermione, with her hands over her mouth. I'm really sorry, Harry. I thought you'd finished, so I cleared up!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry could not bring himself to answer. When the bell rang, he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance, and made sure that he found himself a seat between Neville and Seamus for lunch so that Hermione could not start nagging him again about using Umbridge's office.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was in such a bad mood by the time he got to Divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with Professor McGonagall, remembering it only when Ron asked him why he wasn't in her office. He hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath, only a few minutes late.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sorry, Professor,' he panted, as he closed the door. 'I forgot.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No matter, Potter,' she said briskly, but as she spoke, somebody else sniffed from the corner. Harry looked round.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge was sitting there, a clipboard on her knee, a fussy little pie-frill around her neck and a small, horribly smug smile on her face.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sit down, Potter,' said Professor McGonagall tersely. Her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry sat down with his back to Umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, Potter, this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have, and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years,' said Professor McGonagall. 'Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - ' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes?' Professor McGonagall prompted Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,' Harry mumbled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'd need top grades for that,' said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. They ask for a minimum of five NEWTs, and nothing under \\\\\\\"Exceeds Expectations\\\\\\\" grade, I see. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter, they only take the best. In fact, I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three years.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 At this moment, Professor Umbridge gave a very tiny cough, as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it. Professor McGonagall ignored her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'll want to know which subjects you ought to take, I suppose?' she went on, talking a little louder than before.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Harry. 'Defence Against the Dark Arts, I suppose?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Naturally,' said Professor McGonagall crisply. 'I would also advise -'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge gave another cough, a little more audible this time. Professor McGonagall closed her eyes for a moment, opened them again, and continued as though nothing had happened.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I would also advise Transfiguration, because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work. And I ought to tell you now, Potter, that I do not accept students into my NEWT classes unless they have achieved \\\\\\\"Exceeds Expectations\\\\\\\" or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level. I'd say you're averaging \\\\\\\"Acceptable\\\\\\\" at the moment, so you'll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing. Then you ought to do Charms, always useful, and Potions. Yes, Potter, Potions,' she added, with the merest flicker of a smile. 'Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors. And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than \\\\\\\"Outstanding\\\\\\\" in their OWLs, so - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'May I offer you a cough drop, Dolores?' Professor McGonagall asked curtly, without looking at Professor Umbridge.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, no, thank you very much,' said Umbridge, with that simpering laugh Harry hated so much. 'I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption, Minerva?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I daresay you'll find you can,' said Professor McGonagall through tightly gritted teeth.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I was just wondering whether Mr Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?' said Professor Umbridge sweetly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Were you?' said Professor McGonagall haughtily. 'Well, Potter,' she continued, as though there had been no interruption, if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between \\\\\\\"Acceptable\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Exceeds Expectations\\\\\\\" for the last two years, so your Charmwork seems satisfactory. As for Defence Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you - are you quite sure you wouldn't like a cough drop, Dolores?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva,' simpered Professor Umbridge, who had just coughed her loudest yet. 'I was just concerned that you might not have Harry's most recent Defence Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I'm quite sure I slipped in a note.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What, this thing?' said Professor McGonagall in a tone of revulsion, as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of Harry's folder. She glanced down it, her eyebrows slightly raised, then placed it back into the folder without comment.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, as I was saying, Potter, Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject, and obviously for an Auror - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Did you not understand my note, Minerva?' asked Professor Umbndge in honeyed tones, quite forgetting to cough.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course I understood it,' said Professor McGonagall, her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, then, I am confused . . . I'm afraid I don't quite understand how you can give Mr Potter false hope that - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'False hope?' repeated Professor McGonagall, still refusing to look round at Professor Umbridge. 'He has achieved high marks in all his Defence Against the Dark Arts tests - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I should have made my meaning plainer,' said Professor McGonagall, turning at last to look Umbridge directly in the eyes. 'He has achieved high marks in all Defence Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge's smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing. She sat back in her chair, turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed, her bulging eyes rolling from side to side. Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, her thin nostrils flared, her eyes burning.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Any questions, Potter?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Harry. 'What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you, if you get enough NEWTs?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you'll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth,' said Professor McGonagall, 'perseverance and dedication, because Auror training takes a further three years, not to mention very high skills in practical Defence. It will mean a lot more study even after you've left school, so unless you're prepared to - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I think you'll also find,' said Umbridge, her voice very cold now, 'that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors. Their criminal records.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 '- unless you're prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts, you should really look at another - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'A very good chance, then,' said Professor McGonagall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter has a criminal record,' said Umbridge loudly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter has been cleared of all charges,' said McGonagall, even more loudly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge stood up. She was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference, but her fussy, simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad, flabby face look oddly sinister.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor McGonagall got to her feet, too, and in her case this was a much more impressive move: she towered over Professor Umbridge.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter,' she said in ringing tones, 'I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do! If I have to coach you nightly, I will make sure you achieve the required results!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Minister for Magic will never employ Harry Potter!' said Umbridge, her voice rising furiously.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There may well be a new Minister for Magic by the time Potter is ready to join!' shouted Professor McGonagall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Aha! shrieked Professor Umbridge, pointing a stubby linger at McGonagall. 'Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Of course! That's what you want, isn't it, Minerva McGonagall? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore! You think you'll be where I am, don't you: Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and Headmistress to boot!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You are raving,' said Professor McGonagall, superbly disdainful. Totter, that concludes our careers consultation.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room, not daring to look at Professor Umbridge. He could hear her and Professor McGonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson that afternoon.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I hope you've thought better of what you were planning to do, Harry,' Hermione whispered, the moment they had opened their books to 'Chapter Thirty-four, Non-Retaliation and Negotiation'. 'Umbridge looks like she's in a really bad mood already . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Every now and then Umbridge shot glowering looks at Harry, who kept his head down, staring at Defensive Magical Theory, his eyes unfocused, thinking . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could just imagine Professor McGonagall's reaction if he was caught trespassing in Professor Umbridge's office mere hours after she had vouched for him . . . there was nothing to stop him simply going back to Gryffindor Tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask Sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the Pensieve . . . nothing, except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach . . . and then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father's old Invisibility Cloak.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But the fact remained that if he was caught . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school, Harry!' whispered Hermione, raising her book to hide her face from\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Umbridge. 'And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer's day more than twenty years ago . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then he remembered Sirius in the fire upstairs in the Gryffindor common room . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 You're less like your father than I thought . . . the risk would've been what made it fun for James . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But did he want to be like his father any more?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry, don't do it, please don't do it!' Hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He did not answer; he did not know what to do.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice; he would not look at Harry, though when Hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading Harry some more, he said in a low voice, 'Give it a rest, OK? He can make up his own mind.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's heart beat very fast as he left the classroom. He was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance. There were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them; people exiting the classrooms all around Harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her. Pulling out her wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: it was now or never.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry - please!' Hermione pleaded weakly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But he had made up his mind; hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder, he set off at a run, weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry reached the corridor to Umbridge's office and found it deserted. Dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him, he pulled open his bag, seized Sirius's knife and donned the Invisibility Cloak. He then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached Umbridge's door.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down, then withdrew it. There was a tiny click, and the door swung open. He ducked inside the office, closed the door quickly behind him and looked around.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry pulled off his Cloak and, striding over to the fireplace, found what he was looking for within seconds: a small box containing glittering Floo powder.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He crouched down in front of the empty grate, his hands shaking. He had never done this before, though he thought he knew how it must work. Sticking his head into the fireplace, he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him. They exploded at once into emerald green flames.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!' Harry said loudly and clearly\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced. He had travelled by Floo powder before, of course, but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around ir. the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretchec over the country. This time, his knees remained firm upon the cole floor of Umbridge's office, and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the spinning stopped. Feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head, Harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long, wooden table, where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Sirius?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The man jumped and looked around. It was not Sirius, bu. Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry!' he said, looking thoroughly shocked. 'What are you - 'what's happened, is everything all right?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry. 'I just wondered - I mean, I just fancied a - 'a chat with Sirius.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'll call him,' said Lupin, getting to his feet, still looking perplexed, 'he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And Harry saw Lupin hurry out of the kitchen. Now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs. He wondered why Sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire; his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with Umbridge's hard stone floor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Lupin returned with Sirius at his heels moments later.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What is it?' said Sirius urgently, sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire, so that he and Harry were on a level. Lupin knelt down too, looking very concerned. 'Are you all right? Do you need help?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry, 'it's nothing like that . . . I just wanted to talk . . . about my dad.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They exchanged a look of great surprise, but Harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed; his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion; George had only guaranteed him twenty. He therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the Pensieve.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 When he had finished, neither Sirius nor Lupin spoke for a moment. Then Lupin said quietly, 'I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Harry. He was only fifteen - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm fifteen' said Harry heatedly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look, Harry' said Sirius placatingly, 'James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other, it was just one of those things, you can understand that, can't you? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be - he was popular, he was good at Quidditch - good at pretty much everything. And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts, and James - whatever else he may have appeared to you, Harry - always hated the Dark Arts.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry, 'but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because - well, just because you said you were bored,' he finished, with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm not proud of it,' said Sirius quickly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Lupin looked sideways at Sirius, then said, 'Look, Harry, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did - everyone thought they were the height of cool - if they sometimes got a bit carried away - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Lupin smiled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He kept messing up his hair,' said Harry in a pained voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius and Lupin laughed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'd forgotten he used to do that,' said Sirius affectionately.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Was he playing with the Snitch?' said Lupin eagerly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry, watching uncomprehendingly as Sirius and Lupin beamed reminiscently. 'Well . . . I thought he was a bit of an idiot.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course he was a bit of an idiot!' said Sirius bracingly, 'we were all idiots! Well - not Moony so much,' he said fairly, looking at Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Lupin shook his head. 'Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?' he said. 'Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, well,' said Sirius, 'you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes . . . that was something . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And,' said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, 'he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,' said Sirius, shrugging, 'he couldn't stop himself showing off whenever he got near her.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How come she married him?' Harry asked miserably. 'She hated him!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nah, she didn't,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She started going out with him in seventh year,' said Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Once James had deflated his head a bit,' said Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,' said Lupin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Even Snape?' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Lupin slowly, 'Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down, could you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And my mum was OK with that?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth,' said Sirius. 'I mean, James didn't take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look,' he said, 'your father was the best friend I ever had and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, OK,' said Harry heavily. 'I just never thought I'd feel sorry for Snape.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Now you mention it,' said Lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, 'how did Snape react when he found you'd seen all this?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He told me he'd never teach me Occlumency again,' said Harry indifferently, 'like that's a big disappoint-\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He WHAT?' shouted Sirius, causing Harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you serious, Harry?' said Lupin quickly. 'He's stopped giving you lessons?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry, surprised at what he considered a great over-reaction. 'But it's OK, I don't care, it's a bit of a relief to tell you the - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm coming up there to have a word with Snape!' said Sirius forcefully, and he actually made to stand up, but Lupin wrenched him back down again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'If anyone's going to tell Snape it will be me!' he said firmly. 'But Harry, first of all, you're to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons - when Dumbledore hears - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I can't tell him that, he'd kill me!' said Harry, outraged. 'You didn't see him when we got out of the Pensieve.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Harry there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency!' said Lupin sternly. 'Do you understand me? Nothing!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'OK, OK,' said Harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed. 'I'll . . . I'll try and say something to him . . . but it won't be - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He fell silent. He could hear distant footsteps.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Sirius, glancing behind him. 'It must be somebody your end.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry's heart skipped several beats.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'd better go!' he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the Grimmauld Place fire. For a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders, then he found himself kneeling in front of Umbridge's fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Quickly, quickly!' he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. 'Ah, she's left it open - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry dived for the Invisibility Cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when Filch burst into the office. He looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in Umbridge's desk and began rifling through the papers inside it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Approval for Whipping . . . Approval for Whipping . . . I can do it at last . . . they've had it coming to them for years . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door, clutching it to his chest.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the Invisibility Cloak was completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after Filch, who was hobbling along faster than Harry had ever seen him go.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 One landing down from Umbridge's office, Harry thought it was safe to become visible again. He pulled off the Cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards. There was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the Entrance Hall. He ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was just like the night when Trelawney had been sacked. Students were standing all around the walls in a great ring (some of them, Harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like Stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. Prominent among the onlookers were members of the Inquisitorial Squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves, and Peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at Fred and George who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So!' said Umbridge triumphantly. Harry realised she was standing\\u00a0 \\u00a0 just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey. 'So - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Pretty amusing, yeah,' said Fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I've got the form, Headmistress,' he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk. 'I've got the form and I've got the whips waiting . . . oh, let me do it now . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Very good, Argus,' she said. 'You two,' she went on, gazing down at Fred and George, 'are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You know what?' said Fred. 'I don't think we are.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He turned to his twin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'George,' said Fred, 'I think we've outgrown full-time education.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, I've been feeling that way myself,' said George lightly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?' asked Fred.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Definitely,' said George.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Accio brooms!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left, he ducked just in time. Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners; they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We won't be seeing you,' Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,' said George, mounting his own.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, Diagon Alley - Weasley' Wizarding Wheezes,' he said in a loud voice. 'Our new premises!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,' added George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'STOP THEM!' shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Give her hell from us, Peeves.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And Peeves, who Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"\\u00a0\\u201cSo Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to help him?\\\\\\u00a0\\\\\\\"If you ask. that once more,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"I'm going to stick this sprout \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'm only checking!\\\\\\\" said Ron. They were standing alone at the Burrow's kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes, Snape was offering to help him!\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"He said he'd promised Malfoy's mother to protect him, that he'd made an Un-breakable Oath or something \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"An Unbreakable Vow?\\\\\\\" said Ron, looking stunned. \\\\\\\"Nah, he can't have. . . . Are you sure?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes, I'm sure,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Why, what does it mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\u201cWell, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You die,\\\\\\\" said Ron simply. \\\\\\\"Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went mental,\\\\\\\" said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. \\\\\\\"Only time I've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum, Fred reckons his left but-tock has never been the same since.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, well, passing over Fred's left buttock \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I beg your pardon?\\\\\\\" said Fred's voice as the twins entered the kitchen.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Aaah, George, look at this. They're using knives and everything. Bless them.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'll be seventeen in two and a bit months' time,\\\\\\\" said Ron grumpily, \\\\\\\"and then I'll be able to do it by magic!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But meanwhile,\\\\\\\" said George, sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it, \\\\\\\"we can enjoy watching you demon-strate the correct use of a \\u2014 whoops-a-daisy!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You made me do that!\\\\\\\" said Ron angrily, sucking his cut thumb. \\\\\\\"You wait, when I'm seventeen \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'm sure you'll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills,\\\\\\\" yawned Fred.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,\\\\\\\" said George, \\\\\\\"what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called \\u2014 unless our information is faulty \\u2014 Lavender Brown?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. \\\\\\\"Mind your own business.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What a snappy retort,\\\\\\\" said Fred. \\\\\\\"I really don't know how you think of them. No, what we wanted to know was... how did it happen?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What d'you mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Did she have an accident or something?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" ..|;\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Care-ful, now!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand,\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Ron!\\\\\\\" she said furiously. \\\\\\\"Don't you ever let me see you throw-ing knives again!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I wont,\\\\\\\" said Ron, \\\\\\\"let you see,\\\\\\\" he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Fred, George, I'm sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.\\\\\\\" ;\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No problem,\\\\\\\" said George.\\u00a0- \\\\\\\"Then, as Charlie isn't coming home, that just leaves Harry and ;|/ Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny \\u2014\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"\\u2014 that'll make Ginny's Christmas \\u2014\\\\\\\" muttered Fred. \\\\\\\"\\u2014 everyone should be comfortable. Well, they'll have a bed, anyway,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?\\\\\\\" asked Fred. Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. \\\\\\\"No, he's busy, I expect, at the Ministry.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Or he's the world's biggest prat,\\\\\\\" said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. \\\\\\\"One of the two. \\\\\\\"Well, let's get going, then, George.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What are you two up to?\\\\\\\" asked Ron. \\\\\\\"Cant you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we'll be free\\u00a0too!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I don't think we can do that,\\\\\\\" said Fred seriously. \\\\\\\"It's very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs \\u2014\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"\\u2014 and if you want people to help you, Ron,\\\\\\\" added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, \\\\\\\"I wouldn't chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We're off to the village, there's a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are some-thing marvelous . . , almost like real magic. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Gits,\\\\\\\" said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard. \\\\\\\"Would've only taken them ten seconds and then we could've gone too.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I couldn't,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I promised Dumbledore I wouldn't wander off while I'm staying here.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, \\\\\\\"Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yep,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I'm going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore\\u2019s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Pity you didn't hear what Malfoy\\u2019s actually doing, though.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I couldn't have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, \\\\\\\" 'Course, you know what they'll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They'll say Snape isn't really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy's up to.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"They didn't hear him,\\\\\\\" said Harry flatly. \\\\\\\"No one's that good an actor, not even Snape.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah . . . I'm just saying, though/' said Ron.\\u00a0Harry turned to face him, frowning. \\\\\\\"You think I'm right, though?\\\\\\\" ,\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, I do!\\\\\\\" said Ron hastily. \\\\\\\"Seriously, I do! But they're all convinced Snape's in the Order, aren't they?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he's doing. . . .\\u00a0This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportu-nity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared from Slughorn's party before he returned to it, or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him at the time.\\u00a0Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Mal-foy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry felt fully justified in saying \\\\\\\"I told you so,\\\\\\\" which he had done sev-eral times to Ron already.\\u00a0Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as hr pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to il.s back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.\\u00a0They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasleys favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume con-trol, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a par-ticularly jazzy number called \\\\\\\"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\\\\\\\" Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice.\\u00a0Oh, come and stir my cauldron,\\u00a0And if you do it right,\\u00a0I'll boil you up some hot strong love\\u00a0To keep you warm tonight.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"We danced to this when we were eighteen!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, wiping her eyes on her knitting. \\\\\\\"Do you remember, Arthur?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Mphf?\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. \\\\\\\"Oh yes ... marvelous tune . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry, who was sitting next to him.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Sorry about this,\\\\\\\" he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. \\\\\\\"Be over soon.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No problem,\\\\\\\" said Harry, grinning. \\\\\\\"Has it been busy at the Ministry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Very,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley. \\\\\\\"I wouldn't mind if we were getting anywhere, but of the three arrests we've made in the last couple of months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater \\u2014 only don't repeat that, Harry,\\\\\\\" he added quickly, looking much more awake all of a sudden.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"They're not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?\\\\\\\" asked Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I'm afraid so,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley. \\\\\\\"I know Dumbledore's tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. ... I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they're making some progress, and 'three arrests' sounds better than 'three mistaken arrests and releases'. . . but again, this is\\u00a0all top secret. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I won't say anything,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called \\\\\\\"You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I checked, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley at once. \\\\\\\"I went and searched the Malfoys' house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn't have been there.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you'd looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between\\u00a0Malfoy and Snape, As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin's head turn a lit-tle toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina's crooning.\\u00a0Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone? It's left me for a spell...\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Has it occurred to you, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Mr. Weasley, \\\\\\\"that Snape was simply pretending \\u2014 ?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy's up to?\\\\\\\" said Harry quickly. \\\\\\\"Yeah, I thought you'd say that. But how do we know?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It isn't our business to know,\\\\\\\" said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley. \\\\\\\"It's Dumbledore\\u2019s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But,\\\\\\\" said Harry, \\\\\\\"just say \\u2014 just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore\\u2019s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust Severus.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But Dumbledore can make mistakes,\\\\\\\" argued Harry. \\\\\\\"He says it himself. And you\\\\\\\" \\u2014 he looked Lupin straight in the eye \\u2014 \\\\\\\"do you honestly like Snape?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I neither like nor dislike Severus,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"No, Harry, I am speaking the truth,\\\\\\\" he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expres-sion. \\\\\\\"We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that hap-pened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usu-ally do at the full moon.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But he 'accidentally' let it slip that you're a werewolf, so you had to leave!\\\\\\\" said Harry angrily.\\u00a0Lupin shrugged. \\\\\\\"The news would have leaked out anyway. We both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me healthy. I must be grateful.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Maybe he didn't dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him!\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You are determined to hate him, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Lupin with a faint smile. \\\\\\\"And I understand; with James as your father, with Sir-ius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on Dumbledore's orders that Severus questioned Draco.\\\\\\\" ;\\u00a0. . . and now you've torn it quite apart I'll thank you to give back my heart!\\u00a0Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Eez eet over?\\\\\\\" said Fleur loudly. \\\\\\\"Thank goodness, what an 'orrible \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Shall we have a nightcap, then?\\\\\\\" asked Mr. Weasley loudly, leaping to his feet. \\\\\\\"Who wants eggnog?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What have you been up to lately?\\\\\\\" Harry asked Lupin, as Mr, Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, I've been underground,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"Almost literally. That's why I haven't been able to write, Harry; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway.\\\\\\\" -:\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What do you mean?\\\\\\\" '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I've been living among my fellows, my equals,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"Werewolves,\\\\\\\" he added, at Harrys look of incomprehension. \\\\\\\"Nearly all of them are on Voldemort's side. Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready-made.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled more warmly as he went on, \\\\\\\"I am not complaining; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins, stealing \\u2014 and sometimes killing \\u2014 to eat.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How come they like Voldemort?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Who's Greyback?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You haven't heard of him?\\\\\\\" Lupin's hands closed convulsively in his lap. \\\\\\\"Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta-minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were-wolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people's sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually produces good results.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Lupin paused and then said, \\\\\\\"It was Greyback who bit me.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Harry, astonished. \\\\\\\"When \\u2014 when you were a kid, you mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, know-ing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that. At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"But you are normal!\\\\\\\" said Harry fiercely. \\\\\\\"You've just got a \\u2014 a\\u00a0problem \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Lupin burst out laughing. \\\\\\\"Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He called it my 'furry little problem in company. Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved\\u00a0rabbit.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks, looking slightly more cheerful, Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-ing Lupin.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"The Half-Blood what?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Prince,\\\\\\\" said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recogni-tion.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"There are no Wizarding princes,\\\\\\\" said Lupin, now smiling. \\\\\\\"Is this a title you re thinking of adopting? I should have thought be-ing 'the Chosen One' would be enough.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It's nothing to do with me!\\\\\\\" said Harry indignantly. \\\\\\\"The Half-Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I've got his old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" said Lupin reminiscently. \\\\\\\"There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"My dad used it,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on Snape.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway com-ment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupins smile was a little too understanding.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes,\\\\\\\" he said, \\\\\\\"but he wasn't the only one. As I say, it was very popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. , . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,\\\\\\\" Harry persisted.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Not necessarily,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He looked into Harry's face and then said quietly, \\\\\\\"James was a pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him 'Prince.'\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Abandoning pretense, Harry said, \\\\\\\"And it wasn't Sirius? Or you?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Definitely not.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh.\\\\\\\" Harry stared into the fire. \\\\\\\"I just thought \\u2014 well, he's helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How old is this book, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I dunno, I've never checked.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts,\\\\\\\" said Lupin.\\u00a0Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing \\\\\\\"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,\\\\\\\" which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley's expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron's attic bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.\\u00a0Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub-lished. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father's friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .\\u00a0\\\\\\\"She's got to be joking. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what ap-peared to be a thick gold chain.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What's chat?\\\\\\\" asked Harry. '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Its from Lavender,\\\\\\\" said Ron, sounding revolted^ \\\\\\\"She earn\\u00a0honestly think I'd wear ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter, Dan\\u00a0gling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u201cMy sweetheart\\u201d\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Nice,\\\\\\\" he said. \\\\\\\"Classy. You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"If you tell them,\\\\\\\" said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow, \\\\\\\"I \\u2014 I \\u2014 I\\u2019ll \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Stutter at me?\\\\\\\" said Harry, grinning. \\\\\\\"Come on, would I?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"How could she think I'd like something like that, though?\\\\\\\" Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, think back,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Have you ever let it slip that you'd like to go out in public with the words 'My Sweetheart' round your neck?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well... we don't really talk much,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"It's mainly . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Snogging,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, yeah,\\\\\\\" said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, \\\\\\\"Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I dunno,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"They were at Slughorn's party together, but I don't think it went that well.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking.\\u00a0Harrys presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-ing To Master, From Kreacher,\\u00a0Harry stared at it. \\\\\\\"D'you reckon this is safe to open?\\\\\\\" he asked. \\\\\\\"Can't be anything dangerous, all our mail's still being searched at the Ministry,\\\\\\\" replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I didn't think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?\\\\\\\" asked Harry, prodding the parcel cautiously.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Hermione would,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"But let's wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots. \\\\\\\"Nice,\\\\\\\" said Ron, roaring with laughter. \\\\\\\"Very thoughtful.\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I'd rather have them than that necklace,\\\\\\\" said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.\\u00a0Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared, Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch's hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-tacular golden necklace.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Fred and George gave them to me! Aren't they beautiful?\\\\\\\" .: \\\\\\\"Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now we're washing our own socks,\\\\\\\" said George, waving an airy hand. \\\\\\\"Parsnips, Remus?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Harry, you've got a maggot in your hair,\\\\\\\" said Ginny cheerfully, leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"'Ow 'orrible,\\\\\\\" said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yes, isn't it?\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Gravy, Fleur?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0. In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You are as bad as zat Tonks,\\\\\\\" said Fleur to Ron, when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks. \\\\\\\"She is always knocking \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I invited dear Tonks to come along today,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur. \\\\\\\"But she wouldn't come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I haven't been in contact with anybody very much,\\\\\\\" said Lupin. \\\\\\\"But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn't she?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Hmmm,\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley. \\\\\\\"Maybe. I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man who knew all about Patronuses?\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Tonks's Patronus has changed its form,\\\\\\\" he told him. \\\\\\\"Snape said so anyway. I didn't know that could happen. Why would your Patronus change?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly, \\\\\\\"Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional up-heaval ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It looked big, and it had four legs,\\\\\\\" said Harry, struck by a sud-den thought and lowering his voice. \\\\\\\"Hey ... it couldn't be \\u2014 ?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Arthur!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window. \\\\\\\"Arthur \\u2014 it's Percy!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Arthur, he's \\u2014 he's with the Minister!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy's wake, limping slightly, his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of , them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do : more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and there stood Percy.\\u00a0There was a moment's painful silence. Then Percy said rather stiffly, \\\\\\\"Merry Christmas, Mother.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, Percy!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his arms.\\u00a0Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walk-ing stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You must forgive this intrusion,\\\\\\\" he said, when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. \\\\\\\"Percy and I were in the vicinity \\u2014 working, you know \\u2014 and he couldn't re-sist dropping in and seeing you all.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and stared over everybody else's heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George were all observing him, stony-faced.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Please, come in, sit down, Minister!\\\\\\\" fluttered Mrs. Weasley, straightening her hat. Have a little purkey, or some tooding. ... 1 '. mean \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, no, my dear Molly,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house. \\\\\\\"I don't want to intrude, wouldn't be here at all if Percy hadn't wanted to see you all so badly. . . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, Perce!\\\\\\\" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him.\\u00a0\\\\\\\". , . We've only looked in for five minutes, so I'll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure you I don't want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your charming garden . . . Ah, that young man's finished, why doesn't he take a stroll with me?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Every-body looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour's pretense that he did not know Harry's name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also had clean plates.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, all right,\\\\\\\" said Harry into the silence.\\u00a0He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour's talk that they had just been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It's fine,\\\\\\\" he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen from his chair. \\\\\\\"Fine,\\\\\\\" he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Wonderful!\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass\\u00a0through the door ahead of him. \\\\\\\"We'll just take a turn around the garden, and Percy and I'll be off. Carry on, everyone!\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys' overgrown, snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Charming,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants. \\\\\\\"Charming.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I've wanted to meet you for a very long time,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, after a few moments. \\\\\\\"Did you know that?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No,\\\\\\\" said Harry truthfully. |!.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very protective of you,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. \\\\\\\"Natural, of course, natural, after what you've been through. . . . Especially what happened at : the Ministry ...\\\\\\\":\\u00a0He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige, : so he went on, \\\\\\\"I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has \\u2014 most under-standably, as I say \\u2014 prevented this.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Still, Harry said nothing, waiting.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"The rumors that have flown around!\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. \\\\\\\"Well, of course, we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being 'the Chosen One'. . .\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrim-geour was here.\\u00a0\\u201cI assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you?\\\\\\\",\\u00a0Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not. He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, ami the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree. Finally, he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, we've discussed it.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Have you, have you . . .\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pre-tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. \\\\\\\"And what has Dumbledore told you, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Sorry, but that's between us,\\\\\\\" said Harry. He kept his voice as pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour's tone, too, was light and friendly as he said, \\\\\\\"Oh, of course, if it's a question of confidences, I wouldn't want you to divulge . . . no, no ... and in any case, does it really matter whether you are 'the Chosen One' or not?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-sponding. \\\\\\\"I don't really know what you mean, Minister.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,\\\\\\\" said Scrim-geour with a laugh. \\\\\\\"But to the Wizarding community at large . . . it's all perception, isn't it? It's what people believe that's important.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"People believe you are 'the Chosen One,' you see,\\\\\\\" said Scrim-geour. \\\\\\\"They think you quite the hero \\u2014 which, of course, you arc, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,\\\\\\\" he pressed on, without waiting for a reply, \\\\\\\"the point is, you are a symbol of hope lor many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named \\u2014 well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And I can't help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give everyone a boost.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground. Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry to the gnome, \\\\\\\"Funny little chaps, aren't they? But what say you, Harry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I don't exactly understand what you want,\\\\\\\" said Harry slowly. '\\\\\\\"Stand alongside the Ministry' . . . What does that mean?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,\\\\\\\" said Scrim-geour. \\\\\\\"If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impres-sion. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample : opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very easily. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?\\u00a0\\\\\\\"So basically,\\\\\\\" he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few points, \\\\\\\"you'd like to give the impression that I'm working for the Ministry?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved, Harry,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cot-toned on so quickly. \\\\\\\"'The Chosen One,' you know. . . It's all about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are hap-pening. ...\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,\\\\\\\" said Harry, still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, \\\\\\\"won't that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry's up to?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, \\\\\\\"well, yes, that's partly why we'd like \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, I don't think that'll work,\\\\\\\" said Harry pleasantly. \\\\\\\"You see, I don't like some of the things the Ministry's doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hard-ened instantly. \\\\\\\"I would not expect you to understand,\\\\\\\" he said, and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been. \\\\\\\"These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Dumbledore's a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn't think Stan should be in Azkaban either,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"You're making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, with no pretense at warmth, \\\\\\\"I see. You prefer \\u2014 like your hero, Dumbledore \\u2014 to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"I don't want to be used,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Some would say it's your duty to be used by the Ministry!\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Yeah, and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,\\\\\\\" said Harry, his temper rising now. \\\\\\\"You're doing what Barty Crouch\\u00a0did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we've got Fudge, pretending everything's lovely while people get murdered right under his nose, or we've got you, chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you've got 'the Chosen One' work-ing for you!\\\\\\\" ' i\\u00a0\\\\\\\"So you're not 'the Chosen One'?\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour. '\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I thought you said it didn't matter either way?\\\\\\\" said Harry, with a bitter laugh. \\\\\\\"Not to you anyway.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I shouldn't have said that,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour quickly. \\\\\\\"It was tactless \\u2014\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, it was honest,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"One of the only honest things you've said to me. You don't care whether I live or die, but you do care that I help you convince everyone you're winning the war against Voldemort. I haven't forgotten, Minister....\\\\\\\"\\u00a0He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"I don't remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn't so keen to be pals last year.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"What is Dumbledore up to?\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour brusquely. \\\\\\\"Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No idea,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"And you wouldn't tell me if you knew,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, \\\\\\\"would you?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"No, 1 wouldn't,\\\\\\\" said Harry.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can't find out by other means.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"You can try,\\\\\\\" said Harry indifferently. \\\\\\\"But you seem cleverer than Fudge, so I'd have thought you'd have learned from his mis-takes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed he's not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore\\u2019s still headmaster. I'd leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0There was a long pause.\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,\\\\\\\" said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed glasses, \\\\\\\"Dumbledore\\u2019s man through and through, aren't you, Potter?\\\\\\\"\\u00a0\\\\\\\"Yeah, I am,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"Glad we straightened that out.\\\\\\\"\\u00a0And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back toward the house.\\\"\",\n          \"  The villagers of Little Hangleron still called it \\\\the Riddle House,\\\\\\\" even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.  The Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was \\\\\\\"creepy.\\\\\\\" Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.  The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore. Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.  The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.  \\\\\\\"Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their dinner things!\\\\\\\"  The police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement. Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs.  Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.  The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders. They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just been arrested.  \\\\\\\"Frank!\\\\\\\" cried several people. \\\\\\\"Never!\\\\\\\"  Frank Bryce was the Riddles' gardener. He lived alone in a run-down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since.  There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.  \\\\\\\"Always thought he was odd,\\\\\\\" she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry. \\\\\\\"Unfriendly, like. I'm sure if I've offered him a cuppa once, I've offered it a hundred times. Never wanted to mix, he didn't.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Ah, now,\\\\\\\" said a woman at the bar, \\\\\\\"he had a hard war, Frank. He likes the quiet life. That's no reason to --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Who else had a key to the back door, then?\\\\\\\" barked the cook. \\\\\\\"There's been a spare key hanging in the gardener's cottage far back as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping...\\\\\\\"  The villagers exchanged dark looks.  \\\\\\\"I always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough,\\\\\\\" grunted a man at the bar.  \\\\\\\"War turned him funny, if you ask me,\\\\\\\" said the landlord.  \\\\\\\"Told you I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn't I, Dot?\\\\\\\" said an excited woman in the corner.  \\\\\\\"Horrible temper,\\\\\\\" said Dot, nodding fervently. \\\\\\\"I remember, when he was a kid...\\\\\\\"  By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.  But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale. Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him.  Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything.  The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?  As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while. To everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.  \\\\\\\"'S far as I'm concerned, he killed them, and I don't care what the police say,\\\\\\\"  said Dot in the Hanged Man. \\\\\\\"And if he had any decency, he'd leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.\\\\\\\"  But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next -- for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.  The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for \\\\\\\"tax reasons,\\\\\\\" though nobody was very clear what these might be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.  Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.  It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.  Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.  Frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.  The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.  He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.  On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were: At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.  The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.  \\\\\\\"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Later,\\\\\\\" said a second voice. This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank's neck stand up. \\\\\\\"Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.\\\\\\\"  Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of sight again.  \\\\\\\"Where is Nagini?\\\\\\\" said the cold voice.  \\\\\\\"I -- I don't know, My Lord,\\\\\\\" said the first voice nervously. \\\\\\\"She set out to explore the house, I think...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,\\\\\\\" said the second voice. \\\\\\\"I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly.\\\\\\\"  Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.  \\\\\\\"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"A week,\\\\\\\" said the cold voice. \\\\\\\"Perhapse longer. The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.\\\\\\\"  Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word \\\\\\\"Quidditch,\\\\\\\" which was not a word at all.  \\\\\\\"The -- the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?\\\\\\\" said Wormtail. (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.) \\\\\\\"Forgive me, but -- I do not understand -- why should we wait until the World Cup is over?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and double-checking identities. They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we wait.\\\\\\\"  Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard the words \\\\\\\"Ministry of Magic,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"wizards,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Muggles.\\\\\\\" Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.  \\\\\\\"Your Lordship is still determined, then?\\\\\\\" Wormtail said quietly.  \\\\\\\"Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.\\\\\\\" There was a note of menace in the cold voice now.  A slight pause followed -- and the Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.  \\\\\\\"It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.\\\\\\\"  Another pause, more protracted, and then -- \\\\\\\"Without Harry Potter?\\\\\\\" breathed the second voice softly. \\\\\\\"I see...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!\\\\\\\" said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. \\\\\\\"The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard -- any wizard -- the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while -- you know that I can disguise myself most effectively -- I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I could use another wizard,\\\\\\\" said the cold voice softly, \\\\\\\"that is true...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"My Lord, it makes sense,\\\\\\\" said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now.  \\\\\\\"Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder...perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"My Lord! I -- I have no wish to leave you, none at all --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Do not lie to me!\\\\\\\" hissed the second voice. \\\\\\\"I can always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No! My devotion to Your Lordship --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk Nagini?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But you seem so much stronger, My Lord --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Liar,\\\\\\\" breathed the second voice. \\\\\\\"I am no stronger, and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care.  Silence!\\\\\\\"  Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling. The the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.  \\\\\\\"I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail -- courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldermort's wrath --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"My Lord, I must speak!\\\\\\\" said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. \\\\\\\"All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head -- My Lord, Bertha Jorkin's disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"If?\\\\\\\" whispered the second voice. \\\\\\\"If? If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that i could do it myself, but in my present condition...Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful serant will have rejoined us --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I am a faithful servant,\\\\\\\" said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.  \\\\\\\"Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I found you,\\\\\\\" said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now. \\\\\\\"I was the one who found you. I brought you Bertha Jorkins.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That is true,\\\\\\\" said the second man, sounding amused. \\\\\\\"A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail -- though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I -- I thought she might be useful, My Lord --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Liar,\\\\\\\" said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever. \\\\\\\"However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"R-really, My Lord? What -- ?\\\\\\\" Wormtail sounded terrified again.  \\\\\\\"Ah, Wormtail, you don't want me to spoil the surprise? Your part will come at the very end...but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You...you...\\\\\\\" Wormtail's voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry. \\\\\\\"You...are going...to kill me too?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Wormtail, Wormtail,\\\\\\\" said the cold voice silkily, \\\\\\\"why would I kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns...\\\\\\\"  Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh -- an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.  \\\\\\\"We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her. It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.\\\\\\\"  Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with the cold voice had killed a woman.  He was talking about it without any kind of remorse -- with amusement. He was dangerous -- a madman. And he was planning more murders -- this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was -- was in danger -- Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village...but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.  \\\\\\\"One more murder...my faithful servant at Hogwarts...Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will be no more argument. But quiet...I think I hear Nagini...\\\\\\\"  And the second man's voice changed. He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.  And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.  Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer -- What was he to do? The only means of escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him -- But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.  There was sweat on Frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea...This man could talk to snakes.  Frank didn't understand what was going on. He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The problem was that his legs didn't seem to want to move. As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.  \\\\\\\"Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,\\\\\\\" it said.  \\\\\\\"In-indeed, My Lord?\\\\\\\" said Wormtail.  \\\\\\\"Indeed, yes,\\\\\\\" said the voice, \\\\\\\"According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say.\\\\\\\"  Frank didn't have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open.  A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face.  \\\\\\\"Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?\\\\\\\"  The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but Frank couldn't see the speaker. the snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.  Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a  firmer grip on his walking stick and limped over the threshold.  The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn't even see the back of his head.  \\\\\\\"You heard everything, Muggle?\\\\\\\" said the cold voice.  \\\\\\\"What's that you're calling me?\\\\\\\" said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.  \\\\\\\"I am calling you a Muggle,\\\\\\\" said the voice coolly. \\\\\\\"It means that you are not a wizard.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I don't know what you mean by wizard,\\\\\\\" said Frank, his voice growing steadier.  \\\\\\\"All I know is I've heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You've done murder and you're planning more! And I'll tell youthis too,\\\\\\\" he added, on a sudden inspiration, \\\\\\\"my wife knows I'm up here, and if I don't come back --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"You have no wife,\\\\\\\" said te cold voice, very quietly. \\\\\\\"Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows...he always knows...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Is that right?\\\\\\\" said Frank roughly. \\\\\\\"Lord, is it? Well, I don't think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn 'round and face me like a man, why don't you?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But I am not a man, Muggle,\\\\\\\" said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. \\\\\\\"I am much, much more than a man. However...why not? I will face you...Wormtail, come turn my chair around.\\\\\\\"  The servant gave a whimper.  \\\\\\\"You heard me, Wormtail.\\\\\\\"  Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.  And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.  Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6,\n          4,\n          7\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "Interpretation: The polarity score of 0.136 suggests that the text has a slightly positive sentiment, but it's not strongly positive. This means the emotions expressed in the text lean toward the positive side, but the overall tone is fairly neutral with just a mild positive inclination. Range Context: Polarity scores close to 1 would indicate very positive sentiment. Scores close to -1 would indicate strong negative sentiment. A score around 0 would indicate neutral sentiment. In this case, 0.136 shows a moderately positive sentiment, perhaps expressing mild approval or contentment.\n",

        "Interpretation: The subjectivity score of 0.518 indicates that the text is slightly more subjective than objective. This suggests that the text contains a balance between personal opinions, emotions, or beliefs and factual or objective statements, but it leans a little toward subjective (opinion-based) content. Range Context: Scores closer to 1 suggest the text is highly subjective (mainly personal opinions or emotions). Scores closer to 0 suggest the text is highly objective (based on facts or verifiable information). A score of 0.518 suggests that the text likely contains a mix of subjective opinions and factual information but is more on the subjective side. Overall Interpretation: The text analyzed is slightly positive in tone (mild positive sentiment) and contains a balance of opinions and facts, but with a small tilt toward subjectivity. It likely expresses some personal feelings or opinions, though not overwhelmingly so, and doesn't contain strong emotional language."
