        "Daejeon, South Korea’s fifth largest metropolis with a population of over 1.5 million, is located in the central region of the nation. The city is famous for its convenient transportation being a paradise for bread lovers, and some call it the South Korean Silicon Valley, for its advanced technology and research institutions.\\n The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), one of the most well-known national universities, being the center of South Korea’s science and technology is located in Daejeon. KAIST has connotations of academic excellence and reputation for pioneering research throughout the world. Try visiting the campus as public spaces are open for everyone.\\n You might have heard of Sung Sim Dang Bakery, the Michelin-starred bakery that boasts of their long history from 1956. Sung Sim Dang is pretty easy to find as it is located right next to Daejeon Station. Most wellknown for its deepfried soboro (a bun made of flour, sugar, eggs, and dough) buns with sweetened r e d b e a n p a s t e , Daejeon’s exclusive bakery has a long history of over sixty years, being crowded all year round. Such a product is famous for Sung Sim Dang’s innovative attempt as it is unusual to fry a soboro bun. Do not forget to try Pollack Roe Baguette, a salted baguette with pollack roe on the top. It is one of the top three must-eat baked goods in Sung Sim Dang.\\n Just down the street is Sung Sim Dang’s cake boutique. Here, you can get their unique elaborate desserts, such as cakes, tarts, and rolls. They are famous for DDalgi Siru, a strawberry cake that a massive number of visitors line up outside the boutique for a taste. This plays an important role in enabling tourism revitalization in Daejeon.\\n Other than baked goods, Daejeon is an attractive tourist site for young university students to enjoy prop shops and stationery stores, where cute stickers and goods are displayed for your home interior. The Prelude Shop has the most reviews and high ratings due to its unique design and the opportunity for visitors to enjoy a variety of stationery brands. As diary writing is a trend among university students, visiting The Prelude Shop and buying stickers would be a good choice.\\n If you want to taste Korean food, try visiting Tofu House, a place with a charming a t m o s p h e r e b y considerate waitresses. They sell Tofu hotpot, which is slightly spicy with diverse seafood i n c l u d i n g o c t o p u s and scallops. There is an option where you can order some meat, which goes well with the spicy soup. After finishing eating the hotpot, noodles and rice are prepared, which is enjoyed with the leftover soup.\\n After a long journey from Seoul to Daejeon, a nice place to rest your mind and body is needed. Try visiting Yuseong Foot Spa, a hot spring that was visited by the royal family during the Joseon Dynasty. The low-alkaline spring water of the foot spa is said to be effective against skin, neurological, and gastrointestinal conditions.\\n Inside onsite accommodations, Yuseong Foot Spa also offers public baths, particularly famous among tourists who are searching for a refreshing spot to slow down and take a rest. As public baths are a unique Korean culture that most foreigners are unaccustomed to, it could be a meaningful and exciting experience.\\n Daejeon is much like other popular tourist sites such as Busan and Jeju Island. However, it has a very local atmosphere, a variety of both city and countryside attractions, and nice restaurants, meaning that it is a city that is worth visiting. Why not plan for a one-day trip to Daejeon with your friends?\n",
