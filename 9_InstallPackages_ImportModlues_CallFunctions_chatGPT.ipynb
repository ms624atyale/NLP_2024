        "> A <font color = 'red'> **Python library**</font> refers to a collection of modules or functions that provide specific functionality, often focused on a particular domain or purpose. Libraries can be used to extend the capabilities of Python by providing pre-written code that can be imported and used in your own programs. Examples of popular Python libraries include NumPy for numerical computing, pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and requests for making HTTP requests. On the other hand, a <font color = 'blue'> **Python package**</font> is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. A package is essentially a directory that contains one or more Python module files, along with an optional __init__.py file that signifies it as a package. Packages help to organize and structure large codebases by grouping related functionality together. They can also contain sub-packages, creating a nested structure.\n",

So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone. He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf! The Kid knew there was little hope for him. “Please, Mr. Wolf,” he said trembling, “I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.“ The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily. Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.

        "Answer from chat GPT: <font color = 'purple'> A higher value of TTR (Type-Token Ratio) typically indicates greater variability of lexical use. TTR measures the diversity of words in a given text. When TTR is higher, it means that there are more unique words (types) relative to the total number of words (tokens), suggesting a wider range of vocabulary and more diverse lexical usage in the text. In contrast, a lower TTR indicates that a smaller set of words is repeated more frequently, suggesting less diversity and greater repetition of words. So, a higher TTR is associated with a more varied lexical repertoire."

        "Mimi Kim, teaching professor of Korean language, is the co-author of a new Korean language textbook that uses folktales as a springboard for language learning. The 21 stories that make up Tigers, Fairies, and Gods: Enchanting Folktales from Korea progress through increasingly challenging levels of diction and vocabulary while developing students’ cultural literacy.\\n Every semester, Mimi Kim asks her Korean language students at WashU to write their own Korean-style folktales. She says that folktales are “rich in cultural context, and so they provide a very effective backdrop for discussions about cultural practices and perspectives. Students really get into our discussions about commonalities and differences between Korean folktales and the stories that they grew up with in their own communities.” Kim sees cultural literacy as a key tool for the language classroom. Tigers, Fairies, and Gods grew out of that idea.\\n The book is an unusually rich visual object, with vibrant illustrations done in a style that is evocative of Korean animation. Kim and her co-author, Angela Lee-Smith of Yale University, use visual and linguistic cues to engage with students’ cultural knowledge. In “Sister Sun and Brother Moon,” for example, a brother and sister encounter a tiger in their mother’s clothing in a scene that might evoke echoes of “Little Red Riding Hood” for readers who grew up with the Grimm brothers’ tales. That kind of cross-cultural comparison is exactly what we hope for in humanities education, Kim says. “By learning a new language you gain a richer understanding of cultural differences and similarities,” she says. “Folktales are a natural tool for that work. They just needed to be put together in a way that was more useful for students.”\n",
